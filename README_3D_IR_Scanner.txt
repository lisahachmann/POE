Lab 02: 3D IR Scanner

IR3D-arduino.ino must be run with arduino and be able to control the serial ports of the computer running it. The script controls two servos and collects data from the IR scanner. It then packages it all and sends it to Python
IR3D_python.py unpackages the information from arduino and repackages it in a way that is graphable. 
lab2circuit.png shows the electrical connections involved in this project- namely, two servos and an IR scanner, all connected to an Arduino Uno.
